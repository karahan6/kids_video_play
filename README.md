# Kids Video Play

A new Flutter application that ensures controlled and healthy youtube video platform for kids

## Motivation

In Youtube or similar applications, there are two main problems for kids; 

- There are millions of channels in Youtube. Thus, blocking specific channels is not enough,
- The avarage view duration is very small, even they click another video before the current one start.

This application addresses these problems by presenting following solutions;

- The option to list only the videos of selected channels, 
- The blocking time can be choosen to prevent going back or clicking another video in that time period

This is a Flutter application and I use provider for state management shared_preferences for persisting 
data. This is not a product level application because of quato limitation of Google API.
