# Kids Video Play

A new Flutter application that ensures controlled and healthy youtube video platform for kids

## Motivation

In Youtube or similar applications, there are two main problems for kids; 

- There are millions of channels in Youtube. Thus, blocking specific channels is not enough,
- The avarage view duration is very small, even they click another video before the current one start.

This application addresses these problems by presenting following solutions;

- The option to list only the videos of selected channels, 
- The blocking time can be choosen to prevent going back or clicking another video in that time period 

In addition to these, another reason is to create a flutter application and gain familiarity in this platform.

## Libraries used 

This is a Flutter application and you can find usage of following libraries;
- provider and shared_preferences used for state management and persisting data,
- youtube_player_flutter used for playing youtube videos inline,
- flutter_circle_color_picker used for changing primary color of application for user,
- back_button_interceptor used for controlling back button in video play screen,
- html_unescape used for unescaping HTML-encoded strings comes from Google API,

## Roadmap

This is not a product level application because of quato limitation of Google API.
